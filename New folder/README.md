# Data Science Coursework: Stock & Revenue Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains the coursework for the "Python Project for Data Science" course on Coursera. The project focuses on acquiring, analyzing, and visualizing historical stock prices and revenue data for selected companies, culminating in the creation of an interactive dashboard.

The primary goal was to demonstrate proficiency in data collection (web scraping), data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization using Python libraries, specifically in the context of financial data.

## Course Context

*   **Course Title:** Python Project for Data Science
*   **Platform:** Coursera
*   **Provider:** IBM
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Mastering web scraping techniques to extract data from websites.
    *   Utilizing `pandas` for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
    *   Performing basic time series analysis on financial data.
    *   Creating interactive and informative data visualizations using `Plotly`.
    *   Building a simple data pipeline from raw data to a dashboard.

## Key Features

*   **Web Scraping Historical Stock Data:** Automated extraction of historical stock prices (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or similar sources) for a specified company.
*   **Web Scraping Historical Revenue Data:** Automated extraction of quarterly/annual revenue data (e.g., from financial reporting sites) for the same company.
*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and formatting data for analysis.
*   **Data Analysis:** Combining stock and revenue data, performing calculations, and preparing data for visualization.
*   **Interactive Dashboard Creation:** Generating a dynamic dashboard using `Plotly` to visualize:
    *   Historical stock prices over time.
    *   Historical revenue over time.
    *   Combined views for comparative analysis.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **`BeautifulSoup`**: For parsing HTML and XML documents (web scraping).
*   **`requests`**: For making HTTP requests to fetch web page content.
*   **`plotly`**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
*   **`Jupyter Notebook`**: The primary environment for development and presentation.
